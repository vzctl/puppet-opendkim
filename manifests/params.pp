# == Class: opendkim::params
#
# Encapsulates the default parameter values for the OpenDKIM module.
# OS Support: Debian, Ubuntu
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*syslog*]
#   Set true to enable logging via syslog.
#   Boolean, default is true
#
# [*umask*]
#   Requests a specific permissions mask to be used for file creation. This
#   only really applies to creation of the socket when Socket specifies a
#   UNIX domain socket, and to the PidFile (if any); temporary files are
#   created by the mkstemp(3) function that enforces a specific file mode on
#   creation regardless of the process umask.
#   String, default is '002'
#
# [*oversignheaders*]
#   Specifies a set of header fields that should be included in all
#   signature header lists (the "h=" tag) once more than the number of times
#   they were actually present in the signed message. The set is empty by
#   default. The purpose of this, and especially of listing an absent header
#   field, is to prevent the addition of important fields between the signer
#   and the verifier. Since the verifier would include that header field
#   when performing verification if it had been added by an intermediary,
#   the signed message and the verified message were different and the
#   verification would fail. Note that listing a field name here and not
#   listing it in the SignHeaders list is likely to generate invalid
#   signatures.
#   String, default is 'From'
#
# [*internalhosts*]
#   Hosts from which mail should be signed rather than verified.
#   Array, default is ['127.0.0.1']
#
# [*subdomains*]
#  Sign subdomains of those listed by the Domain parameter as well as the actual domains
#  String, default is 'no'
#
# === Examples
#
#  Not called explicitly; referenced by opendkim init and config modules.
